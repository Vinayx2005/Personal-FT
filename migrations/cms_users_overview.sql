-- CMS "Users" module — one call that lists every account across the apps
-- with the apps each person is associated with.
--
-- Source of truth is `auth.users`, not `pft.users`: the signup trigger that
-- mirrors rows into pft.users swallows its own failures (see
-- harden_signup_triggers.sql), so an account can exist in auth with no
-- mirror row. Listing from auth guarantees nobody is missed.
--
-- App association, since no table records membership directly:
--   PFT   — every account. PFT's signup is the only one across the apps
--           (root / dilse / tools are anonymous read-only sites), so holding
--           an account *is* the PFT association. Not conditioned on having
--           entered data — a signed-up user with an empty ledger is still a
--           PFT user.
--   Root  — authored a blog.posts row with site='root'
--   Blog  — authored a blog.posts row with site='pft'
--   Dilse — authored a dilse.stories or dilse.books row
--   CMS   — email is on the CMS author allowlist (kept in sync with
--           apps/cms/src/lib/supabase.ts AUTHOR_ALLOWLIST)
--
-- auth.users is unreadable by the anon client and pft.users has per-row RLS
-- (users_owner), so this security-definer function is the admin read path.
-- The WHERE clause is the gate — a non-allowlisted caller gets zero rows,
-- not everyone else's email.
--
-- Also defines public.cms_delete_user(uuid) — the Delete button on that page.
-- It mirrors delete_own_account() (move_pft_to_pft_schema.sql) but takes a
-- target id, is gated on the same allowlist, and refuses to delete the
-- caller's own account.
--
-- Safe to re-run. Paste into Supabase SQL editor.

-- Dropped rather than replaced: the return type changed when last_sign_in_at
-- was added, and create-or-replace cannot alter a function's signature.
